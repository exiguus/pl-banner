# SVG Scripts

This repository contains three scripts:

1. **Generate File List**: Fetches a list of files from a GitHub repository and saves the metadata to a JSON file (`svgl.json`).
2. **Download SVG Files**: Downloads SVG files listed in `svgl.json` to a local folder (`assets/svgl`).
3. **Generate Name List**: Extracts the names of SVG files from `assets/svgl` and saves them to a JSON file (`names.json`).

## Script 2: Download SVG Files

### Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node scripts/svgl_download.cjs
   ```

2. Force download all files (even if they exist):

   ```bash
   node scripts/svgl_download.cjs --force
   ```

3. Output:
   - SVG files are saved in the `assets/svgl` folder.
