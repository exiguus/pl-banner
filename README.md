## Motivation

I created this project driven by two core motivations:

1. **_Empowering Engineers to Showcase Their Skills_**:
   I wanted to build a tool that helps engineers create LinkedIn banners, making it easier for them to showcase their skills and achievements.
2. **_Pushing the Boundaries of My Technical Abilities_**:
   Dive deeper into the Architecture, Design and Development of Web-Component Applications and Patterns exploring the following technologies:
   - Web-Components with TypeScript and Lit.
   - Vite dev server and build tool.
   - Vitest and @open-wc/testing for component testing.
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing.

## Thanks
